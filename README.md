# FriendFinder

Friend Finder is an application incorporating both front-end design and server-side technologies.  Technologies leveraged include:  HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, among others, 

The application is launched through the Terminal, then the bulk of the navigation takes place in the browser (localhost: 8080).

Once the server has been started and the browser launched, the user arrives at the home page.  Here they can either view all friends available, or press a button to enter a new record along with responses to the 10 questions asked.
